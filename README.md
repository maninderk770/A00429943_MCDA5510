Software Dev in Bus Envir - MCDA 5510

Hello Daniel,
 -> Coming directly from my undergraduate school,  though not in a practical enviornment still have worked upon projects in my
   course work.    
   Java, .Net, C# were all part of the curriculum, at the end of each of the course we were assigned a project so have developed small
   content management systems such as a library management system. 
   
   My name is Maninder Kaur Baria(A00429943). If hard to remember, can be remembered in this way 
   Maninder from Jalandhar (It rhymes).
   Email id: maninderk770@gmail.com
 -> Due to my interest in analytics my focus shifted from software development technologies to learning and trying to implement R more
   often. It feels great to atleast have some familiarity with the technologies discussed in lecture.
 -> Looking forward to strengthen my concepts in this course.
